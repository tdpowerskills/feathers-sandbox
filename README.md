> dove boiler plate app

## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.


## Getting Started with a Sandbox

- CodeSandbox.io
    - https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tdpowerskills/feathers-sandbox
    - Uses VSCode and stock Node.js containers. Containers are regenerated on every boot.
- Glitch.com
    - https://glitch.com/edit/#!/feathers5-sandbox
    - Slower to boot a new fork, but images are saved statefully and your endpoint can be accessed publically 24/7.

## Getting Started (Local)

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/dove
    npm install
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g @feathersjs/cli          # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
